This is a spider I made for scraping wuxiaworld.com, that way you can
get all of the novels you want and read them offline

To use:
Make a subclass from wuxiaSpider
define the url(first chapter of novel if you want to start from the beginning or just the url where you want to start)
and the name

If you have ran the spider before and want to update the chapters, just comment/erase the url and the spider will start scraping from the last chapter going to the current available chapter.

Please support the website and the translator by reading the novels online whenever you can!

This spider was made for my convenience :)

Future (If I don't feel lazy, or feel that adding a new novel becomes cumbersome):
-GUI
-Get the first chapter automatically
-Just scrape the chapter you want, chapter ranges (especially if there's a GUI)
-Export to other formats (pdf, epub, etc.) - .txt is already good enough for me...
